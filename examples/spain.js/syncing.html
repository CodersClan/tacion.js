	<ul>
		<li>For every step, on every slide, tacion needs to keep everyone in sync.</li>
		<li class="step opacity" data-step="1">This is done by broadcasting the <strong>driver</strong>'s state to every <strong>passenger</strong>'s device.</li>
		<li class="step opacity" data-step="2">To make this as easy as possible, Tacion uses <a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a> to handle syncing.</li>
		<li class="step opacity" data-step="3">Using this feature is optional, as not all presentations may need syncing.</li>
