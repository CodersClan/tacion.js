tacion.js
=========
A real-time, mobile presentation framework

TODO
----
- Make the slides for what you get
  - Runs on phones (phone images and support and reference)
  - It's interactive [mario!](http://www.mariomayhem.com/downloads/sprites/smb1/smb_mario_sheet.png)
  - It is easily theme-able, and...
  - Uses CSS3 (fancy)
  - And, it let's you present in a very unique way... (reveal link)
- Add logic setting up driver and passenger mode (also tag body)
- Add tap to toggle passenger mode (with notif)
- Add counter on websocket page
- That's right, I'm controlling your presentation
  - If you you don't like being controlled, you can always toggle it on and off 
  by clicking on the header (show arrow)
- This control is actually a simple sync
  - All assets are actually loaded individually by your mobile devices
  - When the state changes on the "driver" (Me!/Jon!), the presenter's
  device is synced as well
- Syncing, however, is very simple.
  - What if we wanted something more interesting
  - How about a little message for everyone? (textarea)
- So how does it all work slides?
  - import rainbow.js
  - start with index.html
- Update talk outline
- Document code
- Update README
- Add license
- Create github site
- Upgrade pusher account
